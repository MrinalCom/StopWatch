## 📖 About the Project

The **React Stopwatch App** is a lightweight, high-precision timer built to demonstrate the power and simplicity of React's modern Hooks API. It accurately tracks time in milliseconds and is ideal for use cases such as:

- 🕒 Basic productivity timers
- 🧘 Tracking durations in fitness/meditation apps
- 👨‍🏫 Teaching or learning state management with side effects in React

---

This project was created as a hands-on way to explore and reinforce key modern React concepts:

- ✅ **React functional components**
- 🔄 **Lifecycle-like behavior using `useEffect`**
- 📦 **Mutable persistent state via `useRef`** (without triggering re-renders)
- ⏱️ **Millisecond-level timing** using `setInterval`

It's simple, fast, and highly extendable — great for learning or building upon in other apps.
